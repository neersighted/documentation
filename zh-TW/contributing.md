### configure.sh

`configure.sh` is the script to complete some preprocessing task for both developing and packaging building.

Following parameter is available for developing:
- `-e,  --env` -- Environment Check, check whether it is using Fake WSL Environment, normal Linux or WSL.
- `-p, --prsh` -- Check Status of `powershell.exe`.
- `-P,  --pkg` -- Install Needed Packages required by your system for building.

Following parameter is available for package building:
- `--build` -- helper to add the version to wslu header.
- `--deb <distro>` -- preprocessing script for deb packages.`<distro>` should be version code name like `bionic`, `stable`, `kali-rolling` or `buster`.
- `--rpm` -- preprocessing script for rpm packages.

### Build & Install

run `make` to build executables to `out` folder and manages to `out-docs` folder.
run `make doc` to build manpage only.
run `make clean` to remove `out` and `out-docs` folder.
run `make test` to run tests.
run `make install` to install.
run `make res_install` to install just resources.
run `make uninstall` to uninstall.
run `cd extras/scripts && ./builder-docs.sh` to build docs to `gendocs`.

Pass necessary environment variables if necessary. The default installation is in `/usr` folder:
- `DESTDIR`: You can change the destination installation folder. It is empty by default.
- `PREFIX`: You can change the prefix for where to install. It is `/usr` by default.
