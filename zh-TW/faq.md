## What is WSL?

WSL is short for "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which is a Linux Subsystem from Windows 10. WSL provides developers with a familiar Bash shell and Linux environment in which you can run most Linux command-line tools, directly on Windows, UNMODIFIED, without needing an entire Linux virtual machine.

## Why deprecating `wslupath`?

WSL now have a better wsl path conversion tool `wslpath` provided by Microsoft that is builtin for all distros. `wslupath` is still here for compatibility.

## When pinned in the taskbar, why the shortcut created by `wslusc` will have 2 icons?

This is a limitation of WSL and it is expected. when running the shortcut, it will use your Windows X server(X410, VcXsrv, Xming, etc) to create a separate window for displaying the Linux app. Since it is displaying in another app, the window for displaying app will be separated from the original shortcut.
